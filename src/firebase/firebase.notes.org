*** the original way we were siging in 
const provider = new firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider();
** select_account will always trigger the google popup when we sign in.
** signInWithPopup is where we can choose 'Facebook, Twitter, Github, etc.', after enabling it in firebase site
provider.setCustomParameters({ prompt: 'select_account' });
export const signInWithGoogle = () => auth.signInWithPopup(provider);
